A small, real time OS for the ARM Cortex-M4F STM32F4.

Developed on STM32F4DISCOVERY, but should be portable to other 
STM32F4 boards with very little modification.  In fact, with minor
changes (such as disabling the FPU and changing pinouts), it should
be portable to STM32F0 and STM32F1 chips.

Building requires arm-none-eabi-toolchain.  For hardfloat support, see
https://github.com/prattmic/arm-cortex-m4-hardfloat-toolchain or
https://launchpad.net/gcc-arm-embedded.

For flashing and debugging, texane's stlink is recommended:
https://github.com/texane/stlink

With stlink in your path, "make burn" will flash your device.

By default, the shell program in usr/shell/ is built and run at
boot.  The main() function in main.c is called by the scheduler
before task switching begins and should be used to create tasks
that run at boot.
